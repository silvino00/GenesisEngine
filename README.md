# Genesis Engine
  Genesis Engine is a game engine made in C and C++ for learning purposes. Originaly made by Marc Pagès Francesch (@marcpages2020). We (Javier D. Belda González (@JBGelsenorJ) & Silvino Medina Cardona (@silvino00) forked it to develop the 2º assignment for our videogame engines subject in the Development and Design of videogames degree, studied in the UPC.

## Changelog

Shader Pipeline added:
-> All the city geometry is loaded only with shaders.
-> Water demo with simple moving waves and foam simulation.

### Game Objects Inspector actions
 - Transform: Translate, Rotate and Scale the object. There is a scale multiplier which lest ypu scale the Object in all the axis at the same time. 
 - Mesh: Toggle the view of the vertex and face normals. 
 - Material: 
     - Toggle the checkers image. 
     - Remove the current texture. 

### Actions in tabs:
 - Windows: Enable the engine windows. 
 - Edit: 
   - Configuration: Change the engine settings and view graphs about the performance. 

 - Game Object: There are six primitives available to be created at any time. These are: Cube, Plane, Cylinder, Sphere,
   Cone and Pyramid. These are duplicated, the firsts are generated automatically and have no texture coordinates and the 
   ones marked with FBX will be loaded from FBX files and will have texture coordinates.
